Emotion Recognition is the process of identifying human emotion, most typically from facial expression as well as verbal expressions.

# Problem Statement
Our Human face potrays mixed emotion, so we are going to predict whether the facial expression of a person depicts anger, sadness, happiness, fear, disgust or neutrality by calculating the probabilities of these emotions.

# Dataset Overview
Used fer2013 (FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION) dataset.

The dataset consists of 4848 pixel grayscale images of faces.

The dataset contains two columns: emotions and pixels

The 'emotions' column contains a numeric code ranging from 0 to 6, inclusive, for the emotion that is present in the image.

The 'pixels' column contains a space-separated pixel value for each image.

The training set consists of 28,709 examples.

The test set consists of 3,589 examples.

# Models Used
Emotion Recognition using CNN

Emotion Recognition using Nearest Neighbor

Emotion Recognition using Random Forest

# Result
The accuracy for the CNN Model is high as compared to Random Forest and Nearest Neighbor.
